Research Question Ideas: Task 4 Adam Shippit and Ty Schultz
Looking at the data that we have on grizzly bear mortality in BC, we can see what areas and when each bear was killed between 1976 and 2017 as well as how it was killed, the age and what sex the bear was.
We can use this data to see where the most bear deaths were, year by year, and where they were taken out of.
By using historical data such as the population of grizzly bears in BC we can see the impacts on heavily hunted years as well as see what the ideal amount of hunting of grizzly bears would be to maintain a healthy population growth and conservation of grizzly bears.
Since the ban on grizzly bear hunting in 2017, the sightings and population of grizzly bears has increased to the point where they are inhabitting land that traditionally was not grizzly bear territory.
Since the life span of grizzly bears in the wild are around 25 years, and the reproduction of a grizzly bear is 2 to 3 cubs a year, the population will continue to grow and will be seen in the other wildlife populations that they feed off of.
Our data can be used to compare the population growth to the death rate while predicting the future of the population.
We can also see where majority of Grizzly bears were taken out of and see on a map where the hotspots for the bears are.  
We can also see where the population would be if so many in the 70's and 80's weren't killed.

Possible Research Questions:

Where was majority of grizzly bears killed in BC and how has that effected the overall population in BC? ei. How has hunting grizzly bears affected the population of BC and where the population would be
What is the sustainable amount of hunting of grizzly bears, taking into account illegal kills, accidents, ect., to maintain a healthy ecosystem with a growing population of grizzly bears.
What were the trends of bears being killed? Where were they being hunted, what time period saw the most per year? How much animal control action was needed to be taken? How old were the bears being killed (Also effects reproduction of the bears)?
