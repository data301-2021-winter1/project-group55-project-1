# **Research Questions Analysis/Answers:** 

## **Analysis:** 
Looking at the data that we have on grizzly bear mortality in BC, we can see the various information about what areas bears deaths occurred in when each bear was killed between 1976 and 2017. As well as how it was killed, the age, what sex the bear was, and its spatial status.
We can use this data to see where the most bear deaths were, year by year, and where they were taken out of. By using historical data such as the population of grizzly bears in BC we can see the impacts on heavily hunted years as well as see what the ideal amount of hunting of grizzly bears would be to maintain a healthy population growth and conservation of grizzly bears. Since the ban on grizzly bear hunting in 2017, the sightings and population of grizzly bears have increased to the point where they are inhabiting land that traditionally was not the grizzly bear territory. Since the life span of grizzly bears in the wild is around 25 years, and the reproduction of a grizzly bear is 2 to 3 cubs a year, the population will continue to grow and will be seen in the other wildlife populations that they feed off of. Our data can be used to compare the population growth to the death rate while predicting the future of the population. We can also see where the majority of Grizzly bears were taken out of and see on a map where the hotspots for the bears are. We can also see where the population would be if so many in the '70s and '80s weren't killed.

## **Answers:**

### What (MU) Management Units have the highest grizzly bear mortality rate? 

- Given the data presented to us in the bar graphs, we can see that a majority of the grizzly bear deaths were in the 700 Management units. This is by area some of the largest hunting areas available in British Columbia which may lead us a reason as to why the most deaths occurred here.

### What is the most common kill type?  

- Comparing the kill types in our data with the ID of each bear allows us to see the most common kill type was hunter kill, followed by animal control and illegal kill. This in turn provides us with useful knowledge of how these animals were being harvested.

### Which hunt years have the highest grizzly bear deaths?

- Between the years 1976 and 2017, there were many changes in the number of grizzly bear deaths, overall from the 1970s to the early 2000s with exception of a few oddball years we have seen a consistent drop. From the 2000s to the closing of grizzly bear hunting in 2017 we have seen a consistent rise of mortalities though which may have been a leading factor in the change of hunting regulations within BC.
